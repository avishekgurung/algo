    Given an array, for each element find the value of nearest element to the right which
    is having frequency greater than as that of current element. If there does not exist
    an answer for a position, then make the value ‘-1’.

    Input : a[] = [ 1,  1, 2, 3, 4, 2,  1]
    Output :      [-1, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1, -1]
    Explanation:
    Given array a[] =            [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
    Frequency of each element is: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3
    Lets calls Next Greater Frequency element as NGF
    1. For element a[0] = 1 which has a frequency = 3,
       As it has frequency of 3 and no other next element
       has frequency more than 3 so  '-1'
    2. For element a[1] = 1 it will be -1 same logic
       like a[0]
    3. For element a[2] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
       NGF element is 1 at position = 6  with frequency
       of 3 > 2
    4. For element a[3] = 3 which has frequency = 1,
       NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
       of 2 > 1
    5. For element a[4] = 4 which has frequency = 1,
       NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency
       of 2 > 1
    6. For element a[5] = 2 which has frequency = 2,
       NGF element is 1 at position = 6 with frequency
       of 3 > 2
    7. For element a[6] = 1 there is no element to its
       right, hence -1

    Input : a[] = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11, 3, 3]
    Output : [2, 2, 2, -1, -1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1]

    Input  : arr[] = {1, 15, 10}, k = 6
    Output :  Maximum difference is 5.
    Explanation : We change 1 to 6, 15 to
    9 and 10 to 4. Maximum difference is 5
    (between 4 and 9). We can't get a lower
    difference.

    Input : arr[] = {4, 6} k = 10

    absolute difference with x, i. e., element having minimum difference comes first and so on.
    Note : If two or more elements are at equal distance arrange them in same sequence as in the
    given array.

    Input : arr[] : x = 7, arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 9, 2}
    Output : arr[] = {5, 9, 10, 3, 2}
    Explanation:
    7 - 10 = 3(abs)
    7 - 5 = 2
    7 - 3 = 4
    7 - 9 = 2(abs)
    7 - 2 = 5

[59] 12. Coin Change
    A set of denomination of coins are given and a value N is provided.

    1.  Find the total number of ways in which we can make a change.
        For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}
        So output should be 4.

    2.  Find the minimum number of coins needed to make a value N.
        Example, N = 10 and coins = [2, 3, 5], then minumum no of coins needed is [5,5] hence the answer is 2.

    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of
    S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins
    does not matter.

    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}
    So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2},
    {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5.


[60] 10. Rod Cutting.
    Given a rod of length n and a table which shows the price of rod based on

    Rod of length 1 costs 5.
    Rod of length 2 costs 5.
    Rod of length 3 costs 8. and so on.

    If a rod of length 4 is given then the max revenue would be obtained by cutting the rod in two
    halves of size 2 where the revenue would be 2(5) + 2(5) = 10.

    If a rod of length 3 is given the max revenue would be obtained by not cutting the rod.

[67] 36. An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array
    elements so that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively. Number of positive
    and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the
    end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

    For example, if the input array is [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], then the output should be
    [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]

37*.Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number of swaps required
    to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together.
    Input:  arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3}, k = 3
    If we replace 3 with 5 then all the numbers [2,1,3] will be together. Hence only 1 swap.
    Output: 1

    Input:  arr[] = {5,6,3,7,1,2,9,10}, k = 3
    Output: 1

38*. Rearrange array such that:

    array such that all 0’s are shifted to the end.

    Input : arr[] = {2, 2, 0, 4, 0, 8}
    Output : 4 4 8 0 0 0

    Input : arr[] = {0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8}

[86] 3.  Leader board problem.
    There is a game going on whose score is shown on the board. The board shows all players. Each
    player has a userid, score and rank. Higher the score, lower is the rank. We are given two
    methods which has to be implemented.

    getRank(userId) => Takes userId and returns player's rank.

    updateRank(userId, score) => Update the rank such that the player should be placed at correct
    location. Also, the other players location should be changed accordingly.

    1 - 1 - 1 = -1
    1 + 1 - 1 = 1
    1 - 1 + 1 = 1

    Here, k=3 is true. k = 1 is also true. But k=2 is false since no combination sums upto 2.

    Here, if we remove three 5s, then distinct element left in array will be 2 (5,7)
    But if we remove, one 1, one 2, one 5(will not make any difference though)
    then the distinct elements will be 3 (7,1,2)

[114] 9.  There are given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one
    rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. We need to
    connect the ropes with minimum cost.

    For example if we are given 4 ropes of lengths 4, 3, 2 and 6. We can connect the
    ropes in following ways.
    1) First connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3. Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6
    and 5.
    2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5. Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9.
    3) Finally connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected.

    Total cost for connecting all ropes is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost
    for connecting ropes. Other ways of connecting ropes would always have same or more
    cost. For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three strings of 3, 2 and 10),
    then connect 10 and 3 (we get two strings of 13 and 2). Finally we connect 13 and 2.
    Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.

    numbers from 1 to n. Set bit is the number of 1s in a binary number. Unset bit is 0.
    Input: n = 3
    Output:  4
    Reason: set-bit of 1 is 1, set bit of 2 is 1 and set bit of 3 is 2 (has two 1s). So total
    set-bit till 3 is 1+1+2 = 4.

    Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute
    difference between their sums is minimum.
    If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have
    n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) – sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

[141] 11.*Finding a Span. Span is basically used for financial analysis. If we are given a stock
    value of an item per day, then span for each day is the number of days before this day
    where the stock value was less than or equal to this day.

    Lets assume that the array index represents the order of days.

    Eg: arr[] = {6,3,4,5,2}. At 0th day, the value of stock is 6 and so on.
    Now the span = {1,1,2,3,1}
     6 -> No days where stock value was less than or equal to 6 on/before 0th day hence
     its 1
     3 -> No days where stock value was less than or equal to 3 on/before 1st day hence
     its 1
     4 -> On 1st and 2nd day, the value of stock was less than or equal to 4 hence its 2.

[214] 59. Given an array of positive integers. We need to make the given array a ‘Palindrome’. Only
    allowed operation on array is merge. Merging two adjacent elements means replacing them with
    their sum. The task is to find minimum number of merge operations required to make given array
    a ‘Palindrome’.

    To make an array a palindromic we can simply apply merging operations n-1 times where n is the
    size of array (Note a single element array is always palindrome similar to single character in
    string). In that case, size of array will be reduced to 1. But in this problem we are asked to
    do it in minimum number of operations.

    Input : arr[] = {15, 4, 15}

    Array is already a palindrome. So we
    do not need any merge operation.

    Input : arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 1}
    Output : 1
    We can make given array palindrome with
    minimum one merging (merging 4 and 5 to
    make 9)

    Input : arr[] = {11, 14, 15, 99}

    For index = 0, element = 3. We need to find how many elements are greater than 3 to
    its right but these elements should be in an increasing order, eg: the elements
    greater than 3 to its right are 4,7,5,8,10 and 6. But the elements which are in
    increasing order are 4,7,8 and 10. So we consider only these elements hence the

[250] 1.  Finding of spans or finding of next highest element in a list.
    This algo basically solves finding next highest element (which is greater than the current
    element) in a list. The list can be array, linkedlist etc.

    For all elements, we need to  find another element to its right which is higher than the
    element. If there are multiple elements higher than the current one then we choose the
    first element.

    Ex 1
        arr = {4,5,3,7,8,5,1,2}
        4 -> 5
        5 -> 7
        3 -> 7
        7 -> 8
        8 -> NA
        5 -> NA
        1 -> 2
        2 -> NA
    There are several questions modified to use this algo. Eg, a linkedlist's random pointer
    should point to next higher element, finding span in stocks etc.

[297] 77. Given an array of A of n integers and an array B of m integers find the Maximum Contiguous
    Subarray Sum of array A such that any element of array B is not present in that subarray.

    Input : A = {1, 7, -10, 6, 2}, B = {5, 6, 7, 1}
    Output : 2
    Explanation Since the Maximum Sum Subarray of A is not allowed to have any element that is
    present in array B.
    The Maximum Sum Subarray satisfying this is {2} as the only allowed subarrays are:{-10} and {2}.
    The Maximum Sum Subarray being {2} which sums to 2

    Input : A = {3, 4, 5, -4, 6}, B = {1, 8, 5}
    Output : 7

    Explanation
    The Maximum Sum Subarray satisfying this is {3, 4} as the only allowed subarrays are
    {3}, {4}, {3, 4}, {-4}, {6}, {-4, 6}. The Maximum Sum subarray being {3, 4} which sums to 7

[304] 7.  Choice of area.
    Consider a game, in which you have two types of powers, A and B and there are 3 types of
    Areas X, Y and Z. Every second you have to switch between these areas, each area has specific
    properties by which your power A and power B increase or decrease. We need to keep choosing
    areas in such a way that our survival time is maximized. Survival time ends when any of the
    powers, A or B reaches less than 0.

    Initial value of Power A = 20
    Initial value of Power B = 8

    Area X (3, 2) : If you step into Area X,
                    A increases by 3,
                    B increases by 2

    Area Y (-5, -10) : If you step into Area Y,
                       A decreases by 5,
                       B decreases by 10

    Area Z (-20, 5) : If you step into Area Z,
                      A decreases by 20,
                      B increases by 5

    It is possible to choose any area in our first step.
    We can survive at max 5 unit of time by following
    these choice of areas :
    X -> Z -> X -> Y -> X

[308] 3. Find a maximum and minimum element in a BST.


[309] 2.  Longest Common Sub-Sequence.
    A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily
    contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of
    “abcdefg”. So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.

    LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
    LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.
    LCS for input Sequences “STONEY” and “LONGEST” is “ONE” of length 3.


[310] 10. We have a linked list with two pointers. One of the pointer is a random pointer
which points to NULL. We need to point this random pointer to HIGHEST element to its
right.
    Eg. 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3
    5's rand should point to 10
    10's rand should point to 3
    2's rand should point to 3
    3's rand should point to Null

11*. We have a linked list with two pointers. One of the pointer is a random pointer
    which points to NULL. We need to point this random pointer to NEXT highest element to its
    right.
    Eg. 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3
    5's rand should point to 10
    10's rand should point to NULL (as there are no elements higher than 10)
    2's rand should point to 3
    3's rand should point to Null

    Eg. 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 25
    4's rand should point to 5
    5's rand should point to 25
    2's rand should point to 25
    25's rand should point to N

[312] 56. Minimum steps required to get a desired array.
    Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero. We can perform
    following operations on the array.

    Incremental operations:Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
    Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.

    We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest
    possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.

    Input: target[] = {2, 3}
    Output: 4
    To get the target array from {0, 0}, we
    first increment both elements by 1 (2
    operations), then double the array (1
    operation). Finally increment second
    element (1 more operation)

    Input: target[] = {2, 1}
    Output: 3
    One of the optimal solution is to apply the
    incremental operation 2 times to first and
    once on second element.

    Input: target[] = {16, 16, 16}
    Output: 7
    The output solution looks as follows. First
    apply an incremental operation to each element.
    Then apply the doubling operation four times.
    Total number of operations is 3+4 = 7

                       {2, 2, 4, 1},
                       {5, 0, 2, 3},
                       {0, 6, 1, 2}};
    Output : 16
    (2,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,3) OR
    (2,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)

    Input : mat[][] = {{10, 33, 13, 15},
                      {22, 21, 04, 1},

Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is
10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40.
Try using minimum pointer too.


[318] 25. How many different Binary Trees are possible with 'n' nodes.


[319] 24. Sort linked list which is already sorted on absolute values.

    output: -5 -> -3 -> -2 -> 1 -> 4

    Input : -5 -> -10
    Output: -10 -> -5

    Input : 5 -> 10
    output: 5 -> 10

    The inputs are sorted without considering - sign. But we need to sort them considering -
    sign.


[320] 11. Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1.
    For example, if the input string is “00100101”, then there are three substrings “1001”,
    “100101” and “101”, so the answer is 3.

    in both the direction.

    Eg.
    5 - 10 - 19 - 28
    |   |    |    |
    7   20   22   35
    |        |    |
    8        50   40
    |             |
    30            45

    Ex. arr= [-1,0,1,6,6,0,0,2,7]


[329] 1.  There is a continuous stream of strings. We need to store these strings such that we do not have
    any repeating strings. Eg,
    "sam" -> store it
    "ram" -> store it
    "jack" -> store it
    "ram" -> "ram" has already appeared so we need to remove it.
    "ram" -> since there is no "ram" store it.
