1. Given a liked list and a key to be deleted. Delete last occurrence of key from linked.
The list may have duplicates.

Input:   1->2->3->5->2->10, key = 2
Output:  1->2->3->5->10

2. Length of a linked list by recursion.

3. Search an element in a LinkedList (by recursion).

4. Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes which have a greater value on right side.
    12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3->NULL should be changed to 15->11->6->3->NULL
    10->20->30->40->50->60->NULL should be changed to 60->NULL
    60->50->40->30->20->10->NULL should not be changed.

5. Sort linkedlist of 0s,1s and 2s.

6. Clone a LinkedList which has an extra pointer that points to any random node.

7. Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes.
Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is
10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40.
Try using minimum pointer too.

8. Sort a LinkedList (MergeSort method)

9. Rearrange the linked list such that
    1-2-3-4-5 is 1-5-2-4-3
    1-2-3-4 is 1-4-2-3

10. We have a linked list with two pointers. One of the pointer is a random pointer
which points to NULL. We need to point this random pointer to highest element to its
right.
    Eg. 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 3
    5's rand should point to 10
    10's rand should point to 3
    2's rand should point to 3
    3's rand should point to Null
