Linked list has variety of questions but there are few things to know by heart so that it comes handy
while solving the problems.

1. REVERSE
    Its important to know how to reverse a Linked List and also there are many problems that uses
    the concept of reversing a linked list to solve a problem. I have come across several problems
    which can be solved by reversing a linked list.

    Eg. Remove a last occurring node of a linked list. Here, if we reverse a linked list then we
    just need to remove the first occurring node.

    Eg. Point a random pointer of a node to the highest element. This problem cannot be solved
    without using reverse.

2. SORTING
    This algorithm is also very important and can be used to solve many problems. Merge Sort is one
    algorithm that is very important. The merge part is more important as it is used in many problems.

    Eg: Merge two linked list that are sorted.

    And many problems are also solved by first sorting them.

    Eg: Find the union and intersection of two linked list without using extra space. We can solve
    this problem only if we sort the linked lists first.

3. PREV
    The concept of previous. There are many problems where we need to maintain a prevous node. If we
    keep the head a previous and start the pointer from head.next then the problem becomes pretty
    simple to solve.
