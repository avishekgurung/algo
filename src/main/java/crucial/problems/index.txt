1.  There is a continuous stream of strings. We need to store these strings such that we do not have
    any repeating strings. Eg,
    "sam" -> store it
    "ram" -> store it
    "jack" -> store it
    "ram" -> "ram" has already appeared so we need to remove it.
    "ram" -> since there is no "ram" store it.
