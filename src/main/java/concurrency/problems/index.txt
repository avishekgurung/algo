02. Write a program to print numbers alternatively by two threads. Irrespective of whichever thread you start first, the
program should work.

03. Given a number n, the program should generate n threads and each thread should print number in consecutive order.
Eg if n=3, then
    Thread-1 = 1
    Thread-2 = 2
    Thread-3 = 3
    Thread-1 = 4
    Thread-2 = 5
    Thread-3 = 6
    ..... and so on.


 04. Implement a task schedular.

 05. Implement a rate limiter.
