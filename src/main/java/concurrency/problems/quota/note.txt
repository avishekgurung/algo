Req
- In this system, we want to introduce a rate limit not based on the time but based on the number of requests. This is
more like a quota system where based on the tenant or client, we allow only X number of concurrent requests to process.
We are not concerned about the time taken by these request.

- If the number of requests increases the quota then they should be in the queue for processing and should not be
dropped.
