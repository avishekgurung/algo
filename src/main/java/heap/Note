The time complexities of heap are:

1. Insertion of single element: logn
2. Deletetion of single element: logn

The heap stores the elements in an array internally. For each element,
1. Its left child is present in the location (2*i + 1)
2. Its right child is present in the location (2*i + 2)
3. Its parent is present in (i - 1)/2
