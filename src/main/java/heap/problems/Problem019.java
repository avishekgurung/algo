/**
 *
 *  Lets compare the operations.
 *
 *
 *
 *  Fetching the top element : peek()
 *    BH takes O(1) whereas BST takes O(n) (the left most element is min).
 *
 *  Remove: remove()
 *    Both trees will take logN
 *
 *  Insert
 *    Both trees take logN to insert an element
 *
 *  Implementing Balanced BST is complex than BH. Normal BST can get skewed so
 *  normal BST will not be efficient.
