   * We simply need to create a Stack with getMin functionality.
   *
   * Whether we need to implement stack from scratch or if we use Stack DS has to be confirmed.
   *
   * Push, Pop, Peek does the addition, removal and fetching the last element. The only
   * functionality required is of getMin() which can be done by
   *  1. Using another auxillary stack
   *  2. Using getMin algo without any extra space.
