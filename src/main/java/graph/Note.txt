Graph Algo.

    1. Shortest Path Non Weighted:
        For a given vertex, check its neighbours. If the neighbours are not visited then
        calculate their distance and add them in a queue.

    2. Dijkstra's Algo:
        For a given vertex, check its neighbours. If the neighbours are not visited, then calculate
        their distance and add them in the heap. Calculating their distance also involves comparing.

    3. Bellman-Ford:
        For a given vertex, check its neighbours. If the neighbours are not visited calculate the
        distance and add neigbour to queue. If the neighbours are visited, calculate the distance
        and assign the min distance.

    4. Prim's algo (MST):
        Start with a vertex with min edge.
        For a given vertex, find a neighbour with min cost and add it to the min heap.
