13. Given a N X N matrix (M) filled with 1 , 0 , 2 , 3 . Find the minimum numbers of moves needed
    to move from source to destination (sink) while traversing through blank cells only.
    You can traverse up, down, right and left.
    A value of cell 1 means Source.
    A value of cell 2 means Destination.
    A value of cell 3 means Blank cell.
    A value of cell 0 means Blank Wall.
    Note : there is only single source and single destination and there may be more than one path
    from source to destination(sink). Each move in matrix we consider as ‘1’

    Eg. Input : M[3][3] = {{ 0 , 3 , 2 },
                           { 3 , 3 , 0 },
                           { 1 , 3 , 0 }};
        Output : 4
        Exp: Source is at (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1,) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)

        Input : M[4][4] = {{ 3 , 3 , 1 , 0 },
                           { 3 , 0 , 3 , 3 },

14. Given two four digit prime numbers, suppose 1033 and 8179, we need to find the shortest path
    from 1033 to 8179 by altering only single digit at a time such that every number that we get
    after changing a digit is prime. For example a solution is 1033, 1733, 3733, 3739, 3779,
    8779, 8179

16. Consider a matrix with rows and columns, where each cell contains either a ‘0’ or a ‘1’ and
    any cell containing 1 is called a filled cell. Two cells are said to be connected if they
    are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally .If one or more filled
    cells are connected, they form a region. find the length of the largest region.

    Input : M[][5] = { 0 0 1 1 0
                       1 0 1 1 0
                       0 1 0 0 0
                       0 0 0 0 1 }
    Output : 6
    Ex: in the following example, there are 2 regions one with length 1 and the other as 6.
        so largest region : 6

17. Given an array A of integers. Index i of A is said to be connected to index j if j = (i +
    A[i]) % n + 1 (Assume 1-based indexing). Start traversing array from index i and jump to
    its next connected index. If on traversing array in the described order, index i is again
    visited then index i is a magical index. Count the number of magical indexes in the array.
    Assume that array A consists of non-negative integers.

    Input : A = {1, 1, 1, 1}
    Output : 4
    Possible traversals:
    1 -> 3 -> 1
    2 -> 4 -> 2
    3 -> 1 -> 3
    4 -> 2 -> 4
    Clearly all the indices are magical

    Input : A = {0, 0, 0, 2}
    Output : 2
    Possible traversals:
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3...
    2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3...
    3 -> 4 -> 3
    4 -> 3 ->4
    Magical indices = 3, 4

18*. Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters
    in the language.
    Input:  words[] = {"baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"}
    Output: Order of characters is 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c'
    The words are sorted. So b comes before a and a comes before c.
    b -> a, a -> c
    Take the words, abcd and abca, so d comes before a. d -> a
    Take the words, cab and cad, so b comes before d. b -> d
    Hence b -> d -> a -> c

    Input:  words[] = {"caa", "aaa", "aab"}
    Output: Order of characters is 'c', 'a', 'b'

19. There are n cities and there are roads in between some of the cities. Somehow all the roads
    are damaged simultaneously. We have to repair the roads to connect the cities again. There
    is a fixed cost to repair a particular road. Find out the minimum cost to connect all the
    cities by repairing roads. Input is in matrix(city) form, if city[i][j] = 0 then there is
    not any road between city i and city j, if city[i][j] = a > 0 then the cost to rebuild the
    path between city i and city j is a. Print out the minimum cost to connect all the cities.
    It is sure that all the cities were connected before the roads were damaged.

    Input : {{0, 1, 2, 3, 4},
             {1, 0, 5, 0, 7},
             {2, 5, 0, 6, 0},

20. We are given a matrix of nxn where each cell has some positive integers. These numbers

21. Given a matrix that is filled with ‘O’, ‘G’, and ‘W’ where ‘O’ represents open space, ‘G’
    represents guards and ‘W’ represents walls in a Bank. Replace all of the O’s in the matrix
    with their shortest distance from a guard, without being able to go through any walls.
    Also, replace the guards with 0 and walls with -1 in output matrix.
