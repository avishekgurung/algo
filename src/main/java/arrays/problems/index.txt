1.  There is large array which contains a list of votes received by the leaders. We need to find out
    the winner. Eg, arr[] = {4,1,1,2,4,5,3,2,3,4,5,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,3,1,3,5,4,2,3}. There
    are five leaders 1,2,3,4 and 5. Find the efficient solution.

2.  Find the first repeating element in an array. Eg, arr[] = {3,2,1,2,2,3}. The first repeating
    element is 3 and not 2.

3.  Given an array, find a pair of elements whose sum is k.

4.  Given an array of postive and negative integers, find the pair which is closest to 0.

6.  Given an array contain numbers of 0's and 1's such that 1's occur before 0. Find the index of
    1st 0 element. The number are in millions.

7.  Given an array of elements, find if any duplicate element occurs. How can we optimize if all the
    elements are in the range 0 to n-1.

8.  Given a sorted array of n integers which has been rotated unknown number of times. Find logn
    algo to find an element in the array.
    Eg, arr[] = {15,16,19,20,25,1,3,4,5,7,10,14}. Search 5, output = 8 (index of 5)

15. Given an array of size (n-1) where the integers are in the range 1 to n. There are no duplicates
    in the list. One of the integer is missing, find the missing integer.

20. Given an array where all the numbers occurs even number of times except the one number which
    occurs odd number of times. Find the number.

21. Given an array of size n where the elements range from 0 to n-1. Find the element that occurs
    maximum number of times.

30. Given an array of size n+2 where the elements are in the range 1 to n so two elements are
    occurring twice. Find these two elements.

34. An array of size n contains element from range 1 to n and all the elements are repeating thrice
    except one element. Find that element.
