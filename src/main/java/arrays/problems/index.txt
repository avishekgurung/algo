1.  There is large array which contains a list of votes received by the leaders. We need to find out
    the winner. Eg, arr[] = {4,1,1,2,4,5,3,2,3,4,5,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,3,1,3,5,4,2,3}. There
    are five leaders 1,2,3,4 and 5. Find the efficient solution.

2.  Find the first repeating element in an array. Eg, arr[] = {3,2,1,2,2,3}. The first repeating
    element is 3 and not 2.

3.  Given an array, find a pair of elements whose sum is k.

4.  Given an array of postive and negative integers, find the pair which is closest to 0.

5.

6.  Given an array contain numbers of 0's and 1's such that 1's occur before 0. Find the index of
    1st 0 element. The number are in millions.

7.  Given an array of elements, find if any duplicate element occurs. How can we optimize if all the
    elements are in the range 0 to n-1.

8.  Given a sorted array of n integers which has been rotated unknown number of times. Find logn
    algo to find an element in the array.
    Eg, arr[] = {15,16,19,20,25,1,3,4,5,7,10,14}. Search 5, output = 8 (index of 5)

9.  Given a sorted array with duplicates, find the index of first occurrence of a number in O(logn).
    arr[] = {1,1,2,2,2,3,3}, if a number is 2 then return 3 (index of first occ of 2). We can
    practice for last occurrence as well.

10. We have an array of size n where one element occurs more than n/2. We need to find that element.
    We can assume that all the element occurs only once. In the below example, 2 is the req element.
    [2,1,2,2], [2,1,2,3,2],[1,2,2,3,2] etc.

12. Given an array of 0s and 1s where each in row 1s are followed by 0s. Find the row with maximum
    0. Do the vice versa as well, find the row with max no of 1s.

15. Given an array of size (n-1) where the integers are in the range 1 to n. There are no duplicates
    in the list. One of the integer is missing, find the missing integer.

19. Given an array of 0s,1s and 2s, sort them. Dutch Flag Problem.

20. Given an array where all the numbers occurs even number of times except the one number which
    occurs odd number of times. Find the number.

21. Given an array of size n where the elements range from 0 to n-1. Find the element that occurs
    maximum number of times.

22. Given a sorted array with duplicates, find the number of occurrences of a given number.

23. Given an array of 2n + 1 elements where all elements appear twice except one element which lies
    deep inside. Find this single occurring element.

24. Given an nxn array where the elements are in ascending order in each row as well as in column.
    Search an element.

30. Given an array of size n+2 where the elements are in the range 1 to n so two elements are
    occurring twice. Find these two elements.

31. Given an array of with 0s and 1s. Put all 0s in the beginning and 1s at the end.

34. An array of size n contains element from range 1 to n and all the elements are repeating thrice
    except one element. Find that element.

35. How many trailing zeros are there in a factorial of a given number.

40. We have a building of with n floors and we have many eggs with us. When an egg is thrown from a
    floor higher than F then egg breaks else it will not. Devise a strategy to identify the F floor
    by throwing minimum number of eggs.

41.*Given an array of elements find the max difference between two elements such that the larger
    element appears after the smaller element.
    Eg, arr[]={2,3,10,6,4,8,1}. Max diff is 8 (between 2 and 10).
    arr[] = {7,9,5,6,3,2}. Max diff is 2 (between 9 and 7)

50. Given an an array, segregate odd and even numbers such that even numbers are at the beginning
    and odd number towards the end.
