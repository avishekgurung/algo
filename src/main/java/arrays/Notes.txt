1.  If there is a problem where the array is of size n and the elements in the array are in the range
    0 to n-1, then these kind of problems are usually solved by using the arr element as an index.
    Also, if there are no duplicates then the sum of all the elements in k(k+1)/2 where k=arrSize-1.
    Eg. Problem007

2.  Bitwise XOR operator. Learn more about it than just a truth table. Following are the
    characteristics of Bitwise XOR:
    a.  XORing of all the elements in a boolean array would tell you if the array has odd number of
        true elements
    b.  If you have an array with all numbers repeating even number of times except one which repeats
        odd number of times you can find that by XORing all elements.
    c.  Swapping values without using temporary variable
    d.  Finding missing number in the range 1 to n
    e.  Basic validation of data sent over the network.

    Most of the problems which involves odd and even occurrences can be approached by Bitwise XOR.
