A truth table for bitwise XOR is as follows:

      0       1
  +----------------
0 |   0       1
  |
1 |   1       0


We see that Xor of same elements is 0. The Xor operator in java is represented by ^.

Lets see the Xor of 2 and 3. The binary digit of 2 and 3 are

1   0
1   1
-----
0   1 which is 1. So 2 ^ 3 = 1.

This is just an explanation of Xor operator. The use case is mostly when we have to deal with
elements that are repeated.

Following are the operations that are important to know. Refer to truth table for better
understanding.

i.   3 ^ 3 = 0

ii.  3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3
     3 ^ 3 = 0
     0 ^ 3 = 3

iii. 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 3
     2 ^ 2 = 0
     0 ^ 3 = 3

     Xor works more in a distributive fashion. Here, rather than calculating 2 ^ 3, we can calculate
     2 ^ 2 and then we can Xor its result with 3.

iv. 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0 (Same explanation).
