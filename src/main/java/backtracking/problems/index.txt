1.  Find the permutation and combination  of a given string "ABC".

2.  A string S is provided whose length is more than t. A set of valid words W, each of size t is provided. Find the all
    possible combination of t letter valid words that can be formed from S. Eg, S="ABCDE", W = ["DEF", "CAB", "BED"], t=3,
    the answer should be "CAB", "BED".

3.  For a given array of integers, find all the possible sub-arrays. (Ext: Given an array, find sum of all
    possible arrays).

4.  Given an MxN matrix where each element can either be 0 or 1. We need to find the path between a given
    source cell to a destination cell. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1. If the path
    does not exists, then return -1.

    a. Find the shortest path (distance & path).
    b. Find the longest path (distance & path).
    c. Find the total number of unique paths from source to destination.

5.  Given a positive number n, find all combinations of 2×n elements such that every element from 1 to n appears exactly
    twice and the distance between its two appearances is exactly equal to the value of the element.

    Input: n = 3
    Output:
    3 1 2 1 3 2
    2 3 1 2 1 3

    Input: n = 4
    Output:
    4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2
    2 3 4 2 1 3 1 4

    Input: n = 7
    Output:
    1 7 1 2 5 6 2 3 4 7 5 3 6 4
    5 1 7 1 6 2 5 4 2 3 7 6 4 3
    4 1 7 1 6 4 2 5 3 2 7 6 3 5
    …
    …
    Total 52 configurations possible.

    Note that no combination of elements is possible for some values of n like 2, 5, 6, etc.

9.  Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer, return a list of all unique combinations
    of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

11. Given an array of integers and target, check we can reach the target by taking the sum and difference of each
    elements of the array. Eg, arr = {3,4,5} and target=-6 is true because we can get the target by 3-4-5 = -6. Likewise
    the we should get for targets like 12 (3+4+5), 2 (3+4-5) etc.
