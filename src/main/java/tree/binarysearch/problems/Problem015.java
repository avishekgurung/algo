   * We have to use the technique of finding the intersection or union of two sorted arrays.
   *
   *
   *       2          3
   *    1    3     2     4
   *
   *    Lets the two trees be as follows. We need to perform a inorder traversal of both.
   *    Let the pointers be p1 and p2.
   *
   *    Union
   *    if p1 and p2 has same data then do nothing and traverse to next node
   *    else
   *      print the data of p1 and p2
   *      if(p1.data < p2.data)
   *        move pointer p1
   *      else
   *        move pointer p2
