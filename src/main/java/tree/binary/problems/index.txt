25. How many different Binary Trees are possible with 'n' nodes.

26. Given a tree where leaves are represented by 0 and internal nodes by 1, assuming that each
    node has either 0 or 2 children, create a tree given its pre-order traversal.
    Eg: 10100 should create a tree as follows.
             1
         0      1
               0 0

27. Given a Binary Tree with three pointers: left, right and nextSibling. Point nextSibling pointer
    to its siblings assuming that they are all null in the beginning. For our standard tree, the
    next sibling pointer would be as follows:

    1 -> N
    2 -> 3
    3 -> N
    4 -> 5
    5 -> 6
    6 -> 7
    7 -> N

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-alternate-levels-binary-tree/
    Its not printing the alternate level but changing the tree structure.

    same line.

    have a preorder traversal of it using only the right pointers. During
    modification, you can use right pointer as well as left pointers.

42. Given an array of elements, construct a binary tree in level order fashion.
    Eg, arr[] = 1,2,3,4,5,6 then BT should be constructed such that its level
    order is also the same.
