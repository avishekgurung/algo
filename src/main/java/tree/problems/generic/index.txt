The generic tree we shall consider is the tree present GenericTree class in getTree method.

1.  Find the sum of all elements of a Generic Tree.

2.  Given a 4-ary tree what is the maximum possible height with 100 nodes. Assume that the height
    of a single node is 0.

3.  For a 4-ary tree what is the minimum height with n nodes.

4.  For a given array A, where A[i] is the parent of the ith node (assume that the parent of root
    node is -1), find the height of a tree.

    Ex. arr= [-1,0,1,6,6,0,0,2,7]

5. Given a node in a Generic Tree, count the number of siblings and number of children.

6. Level order traversal of generic tree.
