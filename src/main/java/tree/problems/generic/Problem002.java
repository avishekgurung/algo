  /**
   *  A 4-ary tree can hold maximum of 4 nodes in one level. But it can also hold one node.
   *  So considering a node at level 0 to be of height 0,
   *
   *  Node    Height
   *  1       0
   *  2       1
   *  .
   *  .
   *  .
   *  100     99
   *
   *  So the maximum height of the tree with 100 nodes is 99.
   *
   *  If we have a condition that atleast one node can hold 4 child. Then
   *
   *  Node      Height
   *  1         0
   *  2 3 4 5   1
   *  6         2
   *  7         3
   *  8         4
