    arr[] = {1, 11, 100, 1, 0, 200, 3, 2, 1, 250}
        x = 280
    Output: 4
    Minimum length subarray is {100, 1, 0, 200}

56. Minimum steps required to get a desired array.
    Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero. We can perform
    following operations on the array.

    Incremental operations:Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
    Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.

    We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest
    possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.

    Input: target[] = {2, 3}
    Output: 4
    To get the target array from {0, 0}, we
    first increment both elements by 1 (2
    operations), then double the array (1
    operation). Finally increment second
    element (1 more operation)

    Input: target[] = {2, 1}
    Output: 3
    One of the optimal solution is to apply the
    incremental operation 2 times to first and
    once on second element.

    Input: target[] = {16, 16, 16}
    Output: 7
    The output solution looks as follows. First
    apply an incremental operation to each element.
    Then apply the doubling operation four times.
    Total number of operations is 3+4 = 7

    Output: 22

59. Given an array of positive integers. We need to make the given array a ‘Palindrome’. Only
    allowed operation on array is merge. Merging two adjacent elements means replacing them with
    their sum. The task is to find minimum number of merge operations required to make given array
    a ‘Palindrome’.

    To make an array a palindromic we can simply apply merging operations n-1 times where n is the
    size of array (Note a single element array is always palindrome similar to single character in
    string). In that case, size of array will be reduced to 1. But in this problem we are asked to
    do it in minimum number of operations.

    Input : arr[] = {15, 4, 15}
    Output : 0
    Array is already a palindrome. So we
    do not need any merge operation.

    Input : arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 1}
    Output : 1
    We can make given array palindrome with
    minimum one merging (merging 4 and 5 to
    make 9)

    Input : arr[] = {11, 14, 15, 99}
    Output : 3
    We need to merge all elements to make
    a palindrome.

    Input : arr[] = {3, 5, 1, 1, 1}
    Output: 2

    + arr2[i+1] + …. + arr2[j].

    Input: arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0};
           arr2[] = {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1};
    Output: 4
    The longest span with same sum is from index 1 to 4.

    Input: arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1};
           arr2[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1};
    Output: 6
    The longest span with same sum is from index 1 to 6.

    Input: arr1[] = {0, 0, 0};
           arr2[] = {1, 1, 1};
    Output: 0

    Input: arr1[] = {0, 0, 1, 0};
           arr2[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
    Output: 1
