    elements are in the range 0 to n-1.

8.  Given a sorted array of n integers which has been rotated unknown number of times. Find logn
    algo to find an element in the array.
    Eg, arr[] = {15,16,19,20,25,1,3,4,5,7,10,14}. Search 5, output = 8 (index of 5)

9.  Given a sorted array with duplicates, find the index of first occurrence of a number in O(logn).
    arr[] = {1,1,2,2,2,3,3}, if a number is 2 then return 3 (index of first occ of 2). We can
    practice for last occurrence as well.

10. We have an array of size n where one element occurs more than n/2. We need to find that element.

17. Find a pair whose sum equals to K in a rotated array.
    Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, x = 16
    Output: true
    There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16

    Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 35
    Output: true
    There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35

    Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 45
    Output: false
    There is no pair with sum 45.

18. Given an array, only rotation operation is allowed on array. We can rotate the array as many
    times as we want. Return the maximum possbile of summation of i*arr[i].
    Input: arr[] = {1, 20, 2, 10}
    Output: 72
    We can 72 by rotating array twice.
    {2, 10, 1, 20}
    20*3 + 1*2 + 10*1 + 2*0 = 72

    Input: arr[] = {10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    Output: 330
    We can 330 by rotating array 9 times.
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    0*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 ... 9*10 = 330

19. Given an array of 0s,1s and 2s, sort them. Dutch Flag Problem.

20. Given an array where all the numbers occurs even number of times except the one number which
    occurs odd number of times. Find the number.

21. Given an array of size n where the elements range from 0 to n-1. Find the element that occurs
    maximum number of times.

22. Given a sorted array with duplicates, find the number of occurrences of a given number.

23. Given an array of 2n + 1 elements where all elements appear twice except one element which lies
    deep inside. Find this single occurring element.

24. Given an nxn array where the elements are in ascending order in each row as well as in column.
    Search an element.

25. Consider an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. The array has been rotated
    (clockwise) k number of times. Given such an array, find the value of k.

26. Given a value k, rotate the array (sorted) to its left (anti-clockwise rotation).
    arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k=2, output = {3,4,5,1,2}

28. Print left rotation of an array in O(n) without rotating the array.

29. Rotate two dimensional matrix by 90 degree to its right(or left).

30. Given an array of size n+2 where the elements are in the range 1 to n so two elements are
    occurring twice. Find these two elements.

31. Given an array of with 0s and 1s. Put all 0s in the beginning and 1s at the end.

32. Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N â€“ 1. All elements may not be present
    in the array. If element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange
    the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/
    Input : arr = {-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1}
    Output : [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]

33. Given an array of n elements. Our task is to write a program to rearrange the array such that
    elements at even positions are greater than all elements before it and elements at odd positions
    are less than all elements before it.
    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    Output : 4 5 3 6 2 7 1

    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8}

34. An array of size n contains element from range 1 to n and all the elements are repeating thrice
    except one element. Find that element.

35. How many trailing zeros are there in a factorial of a given number.

36. An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array
    elements so that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively. Number of positive
    and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the
    end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

    For example, if the input array is [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], then the output should be
    [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]

40. We have a building of with n floors and we have many eggs with us. When an egg is thrown from a
    floor higher than F then egg breaks else it will not. Devise a strategy to identify the F floor
    by throwing minimum number of eggs.

41.*Given an array of elements find the max difference between two elements such that the larger
    element appears after the smaller element.
    Eg, arr[]={2,3,10,6,4,8,1}. Max diff is 8 (between 2 and 10).
    arr[] = {7,9,5,6,3,2}. Max diff is 2 (between 9 and 7)

50. Given an an array, segregate odd and even numbers such that even numbers are at the beginning
    and odd number towards the end.
