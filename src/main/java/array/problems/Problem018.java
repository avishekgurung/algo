   * Remember that the rotated array is actually a sorted array.
   * Eg [5,6,1,2,3,4]. The sorted array is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. And its max sum is always an element
   * multiplied by its index. Eg 2*0 + 2*1 + 3*2 + .. + 6*5
   *
   * We have to perform this same logic. Find the pivot and its index which is the max element.
