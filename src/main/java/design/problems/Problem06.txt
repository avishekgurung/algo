Requirements:

    The ATM should have fixed denominations of currency. Eg, 100, 200 and 1000 rupees.
    A user should only enter sum of these denominations.
    The ATM should try to dispense the high denomination notes and then lower denomination notes.
    Eg, if a user wants to 2500 then it should dispense:
        2 * 1000
        2 * 200
        1 * 100

        This will not exhaust the lower denomination notes.


    We use a design pattern which is called a Chain of Responsibility.



    We can also extend it to handle the number of notes of 1000, 200 and 100. As of now, we have
    considered that there are infinite supply of these notes.
