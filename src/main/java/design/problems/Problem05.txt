Requirements

1.  Should support 3 vehicles: Bike, Car and Truck. But should be modular enough such that
    addition of new type of vehicles tomorrow should NOT involve lot of code change.

2.  A bigger vehicle should not fit in smaller vehicle area whereas smaller vehicle can fit in
    bigger vehicle area. The relationship being:

    3 bikes can fit in 1 car area.
    4 cards can fit in 1 truck area.
    So 12 bikes fit in 1 truck area.

3.  Allocation of vehicles should be at their own area in the beginning. But when the spaces
    runs off, then we can allocate smaller vehicles in larger vehicle area.

4.  The design should be modular enough such that addition of new space/area, vehicle should
    involve minimum code change.
