1.  There is a continuous stream of strings. We need to store these strings such that we do not have
    any repeating strings. Eg,
    "sam" -> store it
    "ram" -> store it
    "jack" -> store it
    "ram" -> "ram" has already appeared so we need to remove it.
    "ram" -> since there is no "ram" store it.

2.  Given arrival and departure time of trains in an array. What is the minimum number of platforms
    required to build.
    Input:  arr[]  = {9:00,  9:40, 9:50,  11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
            dep[]  = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
    Output: 3

3.  N queen problem.

4.  Find the sum of all the subsets of an array.

5.  Given a positive integer n, count the total number of set bits in binary representation of all
    numbers from 1 to n. Set bit is the number of 1s in a binary number. Unset bit is 0.
    Input: n = 3
    Output:  4
    Reason: set-bit of 1 is 1, set bit of 2 is 1 and set bit of 3 is 2 (has two 1s). So total
    set-bit till 3 is 1+1+2 = 4.

    Input: n = 6
    Output: 9

    Input: n = 7
    Output: 12

    Input: n = 8
    Output: 13

7.  Find a pair with maximum product in an array.
    Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 0}
    Output: {6,7}

    Input: arr[] = {-1, -3, -4, 2, 0, -5}
    Output: {-4,-5}

8.  Find four elements a, b, c and d in an array such that a+b = c+d.
    Input:   {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8}
    Output:  (3, 8) and (4, 7)
    Explanation: 3+8 = 4+7

    Input:   {3, 4, 7, 1, 12, 9};
    Output:  (4, 12) and (7, 9)
    Explanation: 4+12 = 7+9

    Input:  {65, 30, 7, 90, 1, 9, 8};
    Output:  No pairs found

    Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 200, 300, 400}
    Output: 1+4 = 2+3

9.  Number of subsequences of the form a^i b^j c^k.
    Given a string, count number of subsequences of the form aibjck, i.e., it consists of i ’a’
    characters, followed by j ’b’ characters, followed by k ’c’ characters where i >= 1, j >=1 and
    k >= 1.

    Note: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2
    subsequences are different.

    Expected Time Complexity : O(n)

    Input  : abbc
    Output : 3
    Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc

    Input  : abcabc
    Output : 7
    Subsequences are abc, abc, abbc, aabc
    abcc, abc and abc

10. Highest power of 2 less than or equal to given number.
    Input : n = 10
    Output : 8

    Input : n = 19
    Output : 16

    Input : n = 32
    Output : 32

11. Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1.
    For example, if the input string is “00100101”, then there are three substrings “1001”,
    “100101” and “101”, so the answer is 3.

12. Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a [m x n] matrix.
    We can either move only to right or down.

13. Given only a pointer/reference to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you
    delete it?

14. Given a integer as a input and replace all the ‘0’ with ‘5’ in the integer.
    102 -> 152
    1020 -> 1525
    Use of array to store all digits is not allowed. (Amazon SDET)

15. Find the maximum path sum between two leaves of a binary tree. (Microsoft).

16. Find the number of Islands
    Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an
    island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands.

    {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
    {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}
